      <p>
        The National Football League (NFL) is a professional American football league made up of 32 teams
        divided between the American Football Conference (AFC) and National Football Conference (NFC).
      </p>
      <p>
        Each season culminates in the Super Bowl, where the AFC and NFC champions meet to compete for the
        league title. The sport emphasizes strategy, athleticism, and clock management.
      </p>

      <h2 id="how-to-watch">How the Game Flows</h2>
      <!-- Ordered list: steps in a sequence -->
      <ol>
        <li>Kickoff starts the game.</li>
        <li>Offense has four downs to gain 10 yards (resetting to a new first down if successful).</li>
        <li>Teams score via touchdowns, field goals, and extra points/two-point conversions.</li>
        <li>Defense tries to stop drives, force punts, or create turnovers.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Downs and distance are the core mechanics: move the ball 10+ yards in four tries to keep the drive alive.
        Field position and clock control are crucial to a team’s strategy.
